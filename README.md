# seq2

This library is an extension to the great [jOOÎ» library](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOL).
It mainly provides native handling of pair streams.

## Usage

```java
final Seq2<String> words = Seq2.of("foo", "bar", "foo");
final Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = words.mapToPair(Function.identity(), s -> 1)
        .reduceByKey(Integer::sum)
        .toMap();
System.out.println(wordCounts);
// {bar=1, foo=2}
```

## Getting Started
